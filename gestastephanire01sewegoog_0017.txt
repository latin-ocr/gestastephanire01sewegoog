Author of the ·‘Gesta' being in the camp o'f
Stephon, possibly his own Confesso'r, would natu-
rally be acquainted with all the facts. We may
add, that the accurate Trevet to the full supports
our Author.

As has been before observed, discrepancies
of this kind strengthen rather than invalidate

caused sad ravages in all that remains of the
other. Both, indeed, may be said to be frag-
ments, but they are not the less precious. We
gaze with admiration on the Torso of the Theseus
and the reliques of the Elgin Marbles3 our re-
grets that any part has perished, seem only to
increase our admiration for that which has been
preserved. Such is the spirit in which to con·
template the works before us. Taken together,
they constitute a valuable body of history. They
reciprocally develope the politics of contending
parties3 they serve as guides whereby to arrive
at the probable springs of action: they supply
mutual defects of information; they may serve
to correct mutual errors.

province of the Editor. The original edition of
the ‘ Gesta Stephani’ was printed by Duchesne
in his collection of Norman Auum-s, Paris,
1619. From the title-page it appears to have
been transcribed sro'm an ancient MS. in the
