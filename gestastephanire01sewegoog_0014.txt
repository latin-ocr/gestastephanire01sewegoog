extraordinary under such circumstances, each
confirms the other.

There is one, indeed, great difference between
the works of the Monk of Malmsbury and our
Author. The ‘ Historia Novella' is not limited
to the events of England3 it. embraces the whole
known world: Egypt, Syria, Palestine, Ger·
many, Franee, Normandy‚ each furnish their
several topics3 matters ecclesiasticen, as well
as political and biographical, find a place in his
pages3 and marvellous LegendS, and important
State Paper-S, follow in close conjunctior: one af-
ter the other. Not so with the ‘Gesta Stephani.'
This is confined to the personal history of Ste-
phen. Accordingly, facts are there met with,
which not only M almsbury, but other mitem,
have passed over3 and soenes described with
minute particularity which they have neglected,
or of which they were ignorant. We are trans-
ported at once into the camp of Stephen. and his
Barons; we are present at his Counoils 3 we are
hurried foi-ward in the night-marem we lurk in
the ambuscade3 we take part in the storming
of castles, and citieS. Now we stand in the wild
morasses of the Isle of Ely3 at another time-we
reconnoitre the fortifications of Erist013 from
the hard-fought field of Lincoln, we are carried
to the walls of Oxford3 from the dungeon of the
captive King, we hasten to witness the escape of
the Empress during all the severities of the De-
cember night. It is one stirring series of events
of personal and individual interest3 and in this
respect it pai-takes much more of the character of
a Romance than of History3 it resembles more
the metrical remnants of Barbour and Robert

of Gloucester (save that this is written in prose) ’
