in his narration, and given it thereby the stamp
of truth, and identity which all others have failed
to attain.

Nor let it be objected that these ancient An-
nals are unworthy of credit—that they contain in
them legends the most improbable, miracles that
border on the absurd, if they do not approach the
blasphemans—that soenes are often described in
extravagant colours, and acts recorded that out·
rage probability and truth. We do not reject
the testimony of Livy or Herodotus on great
historical pointS, because they recount prodi-
gies, and miracles, and descriptions of indifferent
things, which we know or believe to be false.
We do not discredit the accounts of the battles of
Cannae, or ThrasymenuS, οι· SalamiS‚ because the
same person who has narrated these, has also
recorded the Bull talking in the Forum, or the
Monsters of Egypt. Nay‚ further, these very
improbabilities have their value; they put the
stam'p of authenticity on the works themselves.
It would be monstrous to suppose a Monk of
Glastonbury, or St. AlbanS, using the language
and cold scepticism of Hume, or the liberalism
of Lyttelton. Such a phenomenon would at
once proclaim a forgery. Nor even supposing
such stories to be false, ought it to disparage
the veracity of those by whom they are narrated.
They, indeed, only wrote what they believed to
be true; the miracles they recounted formed part
of their faith3 and if they sometimes treated the
phenomena of nature, or what modern science
calls phenomena of nature, as supernatural visit-
ations, it may be reasonably doubted whether
their very superstition was not the best voucher
for their adherence to truth, a pledge at least that
they would not wilfully be guilty of falsehood.
