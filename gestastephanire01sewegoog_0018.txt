custody of the bishop of Laon. The scarcity
and price of the ‘ Normannorum Scriptores ’
rendered it almost inaccessible to students of
English history. Added to this, however dili-
gent a collector of antiquitieS, Duchesne must
not lay claim to the title of a careful editor.
The punctuation indeed of his text was singu-
larly incorrect3 so much so, as in many places
to render it totally unintelligible. In other ,
instances manifest errors have crept in, as ‘ve-
nerationi ’ for ‘venationi,' ‘ sestina' for ‘festiva,'
διο. &c. To correct these, and to restore the
text to as perfect a state as was possible, with
as few new readings as could be dispensed with,
has been the object of the Editor. The side-
notes, it is hoped, will form a sufficient key to the
contents of the pages. More foot-notes might
have been added, but he was reluctant unneces-
sarily to swell the bulk of the volume. Added
to this, a Harmony of concurrent historianS,
for which alone many notes are necessary, to
have been perfect would have required the la-
bour of yearS,--and he was unwilling to offer to
the public that which he felt conscious must be
defective. There is but one other duty for him,
the grateful one of acknowledging the accuracy
of the PrinterS, the acuteness and learning of
the Reader belonging to the Establishment of
Meser. Bentley. ,
