interpretation. And therefore, when Malmsbury
alleges that Stephon was more ready in making
promises than in keeping them, every allowance
is to be made for the circumstances in which
Stephen was placed. That ought not to be as·
cribed to intentional fraud, which was probably
the result of unavoidable circumstances. With
intentional treachery or falsehood Malmsbury
does not venture to charge him; and to his high
spirit, his undaunted courage, his affability and
kindness of beart, he bears testimony to the full
as ample as his brother Chronicler.

Take again another instance, and a very im-
portant one, in which the two partizans seem to
differ, and yet agree; Malmsbury accuses Ste-
phen os having violated his Coronation. Oath‚
and of infringing on the liberties of the Church.
The charge is based mainly on the imprisonment
of the Bishops. The author of the ⁶ Gesta Ste-
phani’ represents his hero as the supporter of the
Church. Both, however, are of accord as re-
gards the conduct of the Bishopffi that, laying
aside every other accusation against them, they
had been guilty of something very like high trea-
son. Had they been laymen, there could not be
a question but that Stephen was fully justified.
So that the difference between the two, is one of
inference‚ rather than of fact. And even the au-
thor os the ‘ Gesta Stephani’ does not support the
conduct of Stephen in laying hands on Ecclesi-
asticS. On the contrary, he represents him after-
wards, as sensible of his error,—- to have done
penance‚—-and to have expended the confiscated
property of the Bishops in repairing dilapidated
churches‚ and founding and enlarging religious
houses. The latter part of the account might

not have been known to Malmsbury3 but the ’ ,
